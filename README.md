Abstract:


Credit card fraud is a significant problem, with billions of dollars lost each year.
Machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns that
are indicative of fraudulent transactions. Credit card fraud refers to the physical
loss of a credit card or the loss of sensitive credit card information. Many machinelearning algorithms can be used for detection. This project proposes to develop a
machine-learning model to detect credit card fraud. The model will be trained on a
dataset of historical credit card transactions and evaluated on a holdout dataset of
unseen transactions.
